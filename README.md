# React.useMemo

## Introduction
`React.useMemo` is a hook used to optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations or function calls. It ensures that a value is recomputed only when the dependencies (inputs) change, which can help prevent unnecessary recalculations and re-renders.

## Use Cases of `React.useMemo`

### 1. Optimizing Expensive Calculations
When you have an expensive function or calculation that doesn't need to be recomputed on every render, you can use `useMemo` to avoid recalculating the value unnecessarily.

#### Example: Memoizing an Expensive Calculation
```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveCalculationComponent = ({ numbers }) => {
  // Memoize the sum calculation
  const sum = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating sum...');
    return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  }, [numbers]); // Only recalculate if the 'numbers' array changes

  return <div>The sum is: {sum}</div>;
};

export default ExpensiveCalculationComponent;
```
**How `useMemo` Works Here:**
- The sum calculation is memoized.
- It will only be recalculated if the `numbers` array changes.
- Prevents unnecessary recalculations, optimizing performance.

---

### 2. Optimizing Re-renders of Child Components
`useMemo` can also be used to optimize child components by memoizing the props passed to them.

#### Example: Preventing Unnecessary Child Component Re-renders
```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ data }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
};

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const data = useMemo(() => ({ name: 'John Doe' }), []); // Memoize the object

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent data={data} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase count</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```
**How `useMemo` Helps Here:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders of `ChildComponent` when the `ParentComponent` state changes.
- Ensures `data` remains the same reference across renders.

---

### 3. Preventing Re-creation of Functions
In some cases, functions passed as props to child components get re-created on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders.

#### Example: Preventing Function Re-creation
```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const Button = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('Button rendered');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useMemo(() => () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1), []);

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={increment} />
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```
**How `useMemo` Helps Here:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders of `Button`.
- Ensures the `increment` function reference remains stable unless dependencies change.

---

### 4. Using `React.useMemo` with API Calls
Using `useMemo` with API calls ensures that data is fetched only when necessary, reducing redundant requests.

#### Example: Memoizing API Results
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';

const ProductList = () => {
  const [category, setCategory] = useState('all');
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProducts = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/products?category=${category}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setProducts(data);
      setLoading(false);
    };
    fetchProducts();
  }, [category]);

  const memoizedProducts = useMemo(() => products, [products]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product List</h1>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setCategory('all')}>All</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCategory('electronics')}>Electronics</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCategory('clothing')}>Clothing</button>
      </div>
      <ul>
        {memoizedProducts.map(product => (
          <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductList;
```
**How `useMemo` Works Here:**
- The API call is only made when the `category` changes.
- Prevents unnecessary API calls when the component re-renders.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Performance Optimization**: `useMemo` prevents expensive calculations from running on every render by memoizing results.
- **Optimizing Child Component Re-renders**: Helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components when passed objects, arrays, or functions as props.
- **Recalculating on Dependency Change**: You can specify dependencies, and `useMemo` will only recompute when they change.
- **Use Wisely**: `useMemo` introduces some overhead, so it's best used for expensive calculations or preventing unnecessary renders.

---

## When to Use `useMemo` with API Calls
- When API data is relatively static and doesn't need to be fetched on every render.
- When frequent state changes might cause redundant API requests.
- When performance optimization is crucial to reduce unnecessary fetch calls.

---

## Conclusion
`React.useMemo` is a powerful hook for optimizing performance in React applications by memoizing values, preventing unnecessary re-renders, and avoiding redundant calculations. However, it should be used thoughtfully to avoid unnecessary complexity.

# React.useCallback Hook

## Introduction

`React.useCallback` is a hook used to **memoize functions**, ensuring that a function is not recreated on every render unless its dependencies change. This can be especially useful in optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components or avoiding redundant re-creations of event handlers, which could lead to performance bottlenecks.

## Use Case: Optimizing Event Handlers in a Parent-Child Component

Consider a scenario where a parent component passes an event handler function to a child component. Without `useCallback`, every time the parent re-renders, a new instance of the event handler is created and passed to the child component. This can cause unnecessary re-renders of the child component, even if the function itself hasn’t changed.

By using `useCallback`, we can **memoize** the function and ensure that the child component doesn’t re-render unless necessary.

## Example: Counter with Increment Button

Let's create a parent-child component setup where the parent passes a memoized increment function to the child. Without `useCallback`, the child component would unnecessarily re-render on each click.

### 1. Parent Component (Memoizes the function using `useCallback`)

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Memoized increment function using useCallback
  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // No dependencies, so the function will be created once

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      {/* Passing the memoized increment function as a prop */}
      <ChildComponent onIncrement={increment} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

### 2. Child Component (Receives the Memoized `increment` Function)

```jsx
import React, { memo } from 'react';

// Memoize the child component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
const ChildComponent = memo(({ onIncrement }) => {
  console.log('Child component re-rendered');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
});

export default ChildComponent;
```

## How It Works:

1. **Parent Component**:
   - We use `useCallback` to memoize the `increment` function. The function will only be recreated if one of its dependencies changes. In this case, the dependency array is `[]`, meaning the `increment` function will be created once when the component mounts and will not change during subsequent re-renders.
   
2. **Child Component**:
   - The child component receives the memoized `increment` function as a prop. By wrapping the child component in `React.memo()`, we ensure that it only re-renders if the props change. Since the `increment` function is memoized, it won’t change unless the dependencies of `useCallback` change.

3. **Effect of Memoization**:
   - Without `useCallback`, each time the parent component re-renders (for example, when the `count` state changes), the `increment` function would be re-created, causing the child component to re-render unnecessarily. This can be avoided with `useCallback`, optimizing performance by memoizing the function.
   
4. **Console Log Output**:
   - You will notice that the child component only re-renders when the props actually change, and the log `Child component re-rendered` will only appear when necessary.

## When to Use `useCallback`:

### ✅ Best Use Cases:

- **Event Handlers**: If you pass functions (like click handlers or form submit handlers) to child components, and those child components are wrapped in `React.memo`, using `useCallback` ensures that the function reference remains stable, avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the child.
  
- **Performance Optimization**: If you have an expensive operation inside a function passed down as a prop and you want to avoid recalculating it unless dependencies change, `useCallback` helps.

- **Complex Components or Lists**: In large or complex UIs, where multiple child components depend on the same event handlers, `useCallback` can help prevent excessive renders and improve performance.

### ⚠️ Caveats:

- **Unnecessary Use**: Using `useCallback` everywhere might add unnecessary complexity without significant benefits. It's best to use it in scenarios where function references are passed down to components that could cause unnecessary re-renders (e.g., when using `React.memo`).
  
- **Overhead of Memoization**: Memoizing a function comes with a small performance cost, so if the function is simple and doesn't cause performance issues, using `useCallback` might not offer much benefit.

## Example Summary:

- **Without `useCallback`**: The function gets recreated on every re-render of the parent component, potentially causing unnecessary re-renders of child components.
- **With `useCallback`**: The function reference is memoized, and only re-created if its dependencies change, reducing unnecessary re-renders of child components and improving performance.

---

### Conclusion

The `useCallback` hook is an essential tool for performance optimization in React applications. It prevents the unnecessary recreation of functions and helps optimize child component rendering when used with `React.memo`. However, it should be used wisely, as unnecessary use can lead to complexity without tangible performance improvements.
